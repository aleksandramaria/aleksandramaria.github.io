A personal website about me. I used html, css, JavaScript and jQuery to create a functional website.
As a big fan of simple solutions my site is neat and aesthetically appealing without abundance of detail.
The website is still in progress.
In future I'd like to rewrite code into components in REACT and implement RWD.
